In this run we are using pos images obtained by running the color detector python script on a video file that recorded the robomow running through the yard.

Observations include:

1. The resolution is 400x600 in color
2. The python script used a color identified in the robomow (green) to be the centerpoint, then extrapolated a rectangle from that point that would roughly be the size of the robomow.i
3. hen writes to a annotation file those coordinates as positive position of the robomow in that frame and the frame itself to a file.
3. The annontation file is used with opencv_samples to build the vec file for haar training.

Results:
1. The model generated from this approach significantly outperformed all other approaches.
2. Reasons why may include the scale of the positive image is never distorted.

The conclusion I got to was generated images just did not work nearly was well as the actual images.
